# Python-EDA-Visualization
This project showcases the process of performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python. It includes scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis, providing valuable insights through univariate and bivariate analysis techniques.

# In this project, the following EDA techniques were applied:

1. Univariate Analysis: To analyze individual variables, their distribution, and summary statistics.
2. Bivariate Analysis: To explore relationships between two variables, including visualizations like bar plots and scatter plots.

# Pyhton Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For making statistical graphics in Python.
